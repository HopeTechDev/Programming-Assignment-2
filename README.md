## üìå Description

This Jupyter Notebook provides solutions to two foundational array-processing problems using **NumPy**, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. This assignment demonstrates:

- Creating and manipulating multi-dimensional arrays  
- Performing normalization using statistical measures  
- Filtering elements based on conditions  
- Saving processed data to `.npy` binary files  

The problems solved include:

1. **Normalization Problem** ‚Äì Normalize a random 5√ó5 array using mean and standard deviation.  
2. **Division by 3 Problem** ‚Äì Extract numbers divisible by 3 from a 10√ó10 array of squares.

## üí° Examples w/ Explanation

### 01 üß™ Normalization Problem

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a random 5x5 ndarray
X = np.random.rand(5, 5)

# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean = X.mean()
std_dev = X.std()

# Normalize the array
X_normalized = (X - mean) / std_dev

# Save the result
np.save('X_normalized.npy', X_normalized)

# Print outputs
print("Original Array:\n", X)
print("\nNormalized Array:\n", X_normalized)

```

- A 5x5 array of random values between 0 and 1 is generated using np.random.rand(5, 5).

- The mean and standard deviation of the array are computed.

- Normalization is done with the formula:

- The resulting normalized array is saved to X_normalized.npy.
